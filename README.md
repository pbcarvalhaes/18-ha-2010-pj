# 18-ha-2010-pj Team PMR

These are the code files for the course "Wettbewerb k√ºnstliche Intelligenz in der Medizin" WiSe 2021/2022" from Team PMR.

## First Submission

For the first submission we are putting forward two Jupyter Notebook files named "Detectors.ipynb" and "TreeOptimizer.ipynb" alongside with a folder "std_files" which contain the preprocessed data for the training and the files present on the original 18-ha-2010-pj repository. 

On the first notebook we analyse the database provided with different detectors avaible on the ecgdetectors library. The resulting processed databased is saved on the folder "std_files" as previously mentioned. 

On the second notebook we present and compare different Machine Learning methods based on Tree classifiers using the saved database. All models are multi classifiers, as they analyse and predict the four possible labels.
